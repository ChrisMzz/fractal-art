    <p>
        This is <strong>Fractal Art</strong>, a collection of Python-based programs I wrote to view semi-randomized fractals.<br>
        <br>
        The contents of this collection are : a "browser" built over the <code>napari</code> package, and a "frctlexplorer" I wrote in the <code>pygame</code> package.<br>
        <br>
        These docs are unfinished, so some parts of the website are currently empty.<br>

                    The browser is designed to generate random-ish functions as series expansions to a given order, and is able to
                    display the "Julia sets" of these functions, at a given square resolution. Technically, what's displayed on screen is more of 
                    an approximation of the Fatou components of the function. If you don't know what these are, there are details about it in the manual.<br>
                    <br>
                    The computations leading to such approximates are mostly done with <code>numpy</code> vectorization, so it can get CPU 
                    heavy real quick at not so high resolutions. I'd advise only using the browser to <i>find</i> interesting functions, and 
                    then view them using the explorer.

                    The frctlexplorer is designed to view <code>.frctl</code> files exported directly from the browser. A <code>.frctl</code> file
                    only contains the image at export time, the function's NumPy array, and metadata such as the colourmap or series expansion order.<br>
                    <br>
                    The computations in the frctlexplorer are done by a GLSL fragment shader that is directly available to the users, to allow
                    customisation of the shader computations for GLSL afficionados. Some lines of code are commented out in this one, precisely
                    to make this task easier on users who want to expirement, such as a comment containing a mouse-controlled complex variable
                    <code>c</code> that can be placed anywhere in the function's definition, or <code>hls</code>-compatible functionalities.<br>
                    <br>
                    These are obviously a lot easier on the computer since they're handled by the GPU. However, the default use for the <code>iTime</code>
                    uniform is <strong>iteration count</strong>, so the long the program runs without pausing, the slower it'll get. <strong>Please</strong>
                    be wary of this and press pause (P) when you think the program is starting to get too slow.

        The exported image, when viewed in <code>frctlexplorer</code>, is actually viewed with the colouring it was exported with, which can be switched as 8 other defaults
        colourings are available in the app. Here are a couple images of this exact fractal being explored with its default colouring (left) and one of the other default colourings (right).

        Actually generating these isn't very hard on the user, as I tried designing the browser to be as easy to use as possible. Of course, there are 
        more complicated features than what I'm advertising here, but you don't need more than this to get some really lovely images. <br>
        Saving the selected image and layer exports to a <code>.frctl</code> file that you can explore as shown above.
