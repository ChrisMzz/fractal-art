    <h2>The browser</h2>
    <div>
    <p>The browser can be used to find new random functions. The functions are given by <code>(2,n)</code>
        NumPy arrays, representing the series expansion of the function to the n-th order.<br><br>
        Use the bottom widget buttons or press on the keys associated to them to : </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make a new image (NumPad0)</li>
            <li>Save selected layers as <code>.frctl</code> file in the current save directory (NumPad1)</li>
            <li>Save a gif, only if layer is a 1D lerp (NumPad2)</li>
            <li>Clear all layers (NumPad3)</li>
            <li>Generate a new cmap, with parametric functions layer (R)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can also open the console at any time (<code>Ctrl+Shift+C</code>), select any layer, modify the
        parametric functions manually and with the layer still selected, click on "Push New Parametric Functions"
        to change the current cmap manually.<br><br>
        The command line you could type if you select the topmost layer is for example 
        <code>[layers[-1].metadata[param] = f for f,param in zip([r,g,b],["param_R","param_G","param_B"])]</code>
        where <code>r</code>, <code>g</code>, and <code>b</code> are lambda functions of one variable defined in [0,1]
        representing the new parametric functions.
        </p>
        <div class="row" style="display:flex;align-items: center;">
            <div class="column" style="float:left;width:32%">
                <img src="images/mainwidgets.PNG" style="width:-webkit-fill-available;border:solid;border-width:thin;">
            </div>
            <div class="column" style="float:right;width:65%;padding-left:7px">
                
                <p> The "Global Parameters" widget can be used to determine the order of the function's series expansion,
                    but also to determine the <code>thresh</code> which limits how many iterates are computed to approximate 
                    the Julia set, and the square <code>resolution</code> of the image, and finally the 
                    <code>save location</code> which the <code>.frctl</code> file is exported to.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You can use the "Load Image From Array" widget to import a previously saved image, either as a
                    <code>.npy</code> file of the function array or preferrably a <code>.frctl</code> file.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You can of course enhance an image to a higher (or lower) resolution with the "Enhance Image" 
                    widget, by selecting the layer containing the image you want to enhance. Keep in mind this 
                    recalculates the whole image from the array so it can take some time if you choose high resolutions.<br>
                    If you want a less precise, but higher resolution image, you can always lower the iteration threshold
                    in the Global Settings.
                </p>

                <p> The "Lerp Images" widget allows users to compute a discretisation of the linear interpolation
                    between two layers. The layers' arrays must be of <strong>exact</strong> same shape and the 
                    discretisation is done on [0,1] to exclude functions not strictly "in between" the two given 
                    layers. The resulting layer is of shape <code>(breaks,)+shape</code> where <code>shape</code>
                    is the shape of the given arrays and <code>breaks</code> is the discrete step provided in the 
                    lerp settings.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Note that the <code>ordertxt</code> variable rearranges the cmap parametric 
                    functions, so if you want to just rearrange these on any image you can just lerp an image with 
                    itself and set the breaks to 1.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Once you've lerped multiple times, you can retrieve an image using the console. I didn't include
                    a button for this as it's better done with custom preferences. Typically, to retrieve the image 
                    at (7,19) of a 2D-lerp (lerping lerps), and taking ordertxt to be "bgr", you'd have to write :<br>
                    <code>viewer.add_image(viewer.layers[-1].data[7,19],metadata={"ordertxt":"bgr","arr":viewer.layers[-1].metadata["arr"][7,19]})</code><br>
                    You can then name the new layer however you want and save it as a <code>.frctl</code> file.<br>
                    If you want, you can also save the whole lerp as a <code>.frctl</code> file, in which case it will behave differently than a regular file.
                </p>

    <h2>The explorer</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
        The frctlexplorer can be used to view high-resolution details of the Fatou component approximates generated from a function.<br>
        It should be used as the <strong>default app</strong> to open <code>.frctl</code> files, and can also be opened
        standalone to view the last opened file.<br><br>
        Use the following controls :
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Right arrow key (hold) : speed up Time</li>
            <li>Left arrow key (hold) : reverse Time</li>
            <li>Up/down arrow key (hold) : increase/decrease iteration count (only in animations)</li>
            <li>Left Ctrl (hold) : slow down Time</li>
            <li>P : Pause</li>
            <li>C or Middle Click : Change colour map (random between a select few maps)</li>
            <li>R : Randomize colour map</li>
            <li>F11 : Fullscreen</li>
            <li>F12 : Screenshot (saves to folder where the instance was launched)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Time usually controls iteration count, in which case the up and down keys do nothing, but note that if an "animated" <code>.frctl</code> file is viewed, 
            time will actually control the animation, which will be randomized to move a function around in the convex enveloppe of the N-cuboid constructed 
            from the function array. This is explained further in the next section.<br>
        </p>
        <p>The graphics are custom-controlled by the Python program through the GLSL fragment shader generated on <code>.frctl</code> file open.
            Users can of course close the instance, modify the fragment shader and open the application standalone to experiment.<br><br>
            A couple handcrafted, interesting variables are in the GLSL shader by default, commented out for you to find and try out if you don't know much about shaders.

        <h2>Animations</h2>
        <p>
        A feature of the explorer unique to lerping was implemented, where if a lerped image is saved as a <code>.frctl</code> file, it won't be loaded in the same way
        through the explorer and using a generalised parametrisation of filled cuboids, it was possible to make an animation of a function moving around in the N-dimensional lerped space.
        </p>
        <p>
            The parameter space for an ND space has exactly N parameters that are all controlled by a sine wave of semirandom amplitude and phase,
            and are labelled <code>p</code>. For more interesting results, that would be out of sync, the user is encouraged to also change the frequencies on a lerp!
        </p>
        <p>Have fun messing around with all the controls!</p>
